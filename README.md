# DINOSAUR PROJECT

### INTRODUCTION
This repository holds the code for my very first interactive Javascript webpage. Using object oriented javascript, I developed a dinosaur inforgraphic comparing users (humans) and dinosaurs. Using HTML, CSS, JSON data, and Javascript, I pulled in data from a user form and used it to complete an array of objects to display on the page. 

### HOW IT WORKS
Enter your information including your name, height, weight, and diet. Once the <b>Compare Me!</b> button is clicked, a 3x3 tile will be generated with your human in the center. Your input from the form and the dinosaur facts will be randonly selelcted for each dinosaur on the page. Refresh the page or enter new user input to see different facts about each dinosaur. There is one dinosaur who's fact remains the same, even after refreshing. Can you find out which dinosaur this is?

### HOW TO INSTALL
1. Download the code from this repository.
2. Access a Live server from your local machine (Live Server Extension from VisualStudio Code).
3. Open the HTML in the web browser.

### CHALLENGES
This was a challenging first project, but I'm glad I was able to collaborate and brainstorm with my cohort at Color Coded Labs. During this project I struggled the most with fetching and using the fetched data to geneerate the tiles. After much trial and error I finally was able to use the data and render the expected objects on the page. This project showed me new ways to think about product development and I'm enjoying the journey of learning front end development.
